## Best Practices

1. **Signal Configuration**
   - Start with conservative volatility thresholds (15-20%)
   - Set reasonable ROI expectations (2-5% for intraday)
   - Use tight stop-losses (1-2% below entry)

2. **Stock Selection**
   - Focus on liquid stocks with high trading volume
   - Select stocks from different sectors for diversification
   - Avoid stocks with upcoming earnings or major announcements

3. **Trading Hours**
   - Avoid the first 15 minutes after market open
   - Be cautious during lunch hours (low volume)
   - Consider ending trading 30 minutes before market close

4. **Risk Management**
   - Never risk more than 1-2% of your capital on a single trade
   - Don't chase signals that have already moved significantly
   - Always use the provided stop-loss levels
